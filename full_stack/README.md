# Technical Interview

Using Javascript & React, please build a kanban board! This project should meet the following requirements:

1. The kanban board should have 3 swimlanes.
2. There is functionality to add & delete a ticket.
3. Each ticket should have the ability to have a name and description.
4. Allow each ticket to move between swimlanes. This can be accomplished with buttons on each ticket.
5. Add basic styling using a CSS library of your choice.
6. There is no requirement to persist these tickets in a database.
